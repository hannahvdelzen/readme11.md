# What means 'HACKING' to me? (first thoughts before the practice)

Hacking to me, reminds me of hacking a modern system. For example, our daily routine.
I, as a lifestyle transformation designer, am thinking about our lifestyles, which are changing rapidly throughout different timeframes, this has to do with the fact that there are a lot of diverse systems within our society. And one system is connected to one other. Take the system of connecting with others through data, or your mobile phone. Our mobile phone is already part of a changed daily routine through time. Where we first had to send letters to talk to someone far away, we are now connected with the help of a small device, to everyone, everywhere.


# WEEK 1


# 13/05

- Hacking introduction

Assignment:
Introduce yourself through a component that constitutes 'you' (natural or artificial)

A component that constitutes me, are my clothes. My daily outfit creates an extra layer to my body, an extra layer on top of my body, or my clothes could be a part of my body. My outfit tells me how I feel that day. To me, the way I dress myself is very important in my lifestyle. My clothes are nor natural or artificial. They have always been there.


- Manifesto

I have red 'A hacker manifesto' by McKenzie Wark. The manifesto talks about the hacker class. The hacker class is able to crack a code, but the code doesn’t have to be virtual. In art, in science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge where data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and where in that information new possibilities for the world are produced, there are hackers hacking the new out of the old. The manifesto reflects on the term ‘ownership’ within the hacking culture. What is the true domain of the hacker?



# 15/05

- Lecture Florian Cramer

We listened to a lecture of Florian Cramer about the history of hacking.
Cramer told us about the principles of hacking. He told that hacking is always an open access and it has to be open for the public. Hacking has got no limitations when it comes to copyright. A hacker is playing with existing systems.

Definition of a hacker;
“A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities”
“An expert or enhusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.
“One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming of circumventing limitations.
“(Deprecated) A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around.”

- Inspection tools

We had to bring an inspection/observation tool to class. I brought my Apple Iphone as an inspection tool. We inspected our inspection tool with the help of the following questions:

OBJECT = My telephone

Describe the object from your point of view; what are its performative qualities and affordances; in which context can it be used? How can you use it as an inspection / intervention tool?

My telephone can be used in a social context, it is a tool to communicate with others. I can also use my phone to search for information on the internet. I can make pictures with it, videos, record sound and I am able to document it immediately. I can use my phone to look at the time, it is a small device which is a big part of our reality, even though it is a ‘machine’. It is a wireless machine which is able to ‘live’ with or without me. With me it has extra data, without me it is just ‘a phone’. The phone has got a lot of information on it, such as contacts, photos and other media. The phone is a box and the data is within this box. Without my personal data my phone is just a box, but still has many possibilities.

Describe the object from the point of view of the object; build a small glossary for the object - “as if it would speak and have a language of its own”’ you can look into references and find “members of the same family”.

"I am iPhone van Hannah van den Elzen, I am iPhone number 7 and I have a body which can grow 128 GB big. You can feed me with loads of personal data. I can hold your photo’s, your contacts, your messages, your social life actually. This makes me your diary, as well. You can feed me and feed me. Feed me till I weigh 128 GB. But, if you give me too much food,I can’t hold it, I will spit it out then. There goes your social life…. You cry and you cry, because you lost your persona. But maybe this makes you realize, that you have to be careful with me: I am a part of your personality. When I suddenly die, a part of YOU dies as well. Unless you cheat on me and you have your information stored on another device as well, from my point of view, do you think I am not good enough? Not big enough? I can’t eat that much you want me to?
Don’t over estimate me girl… I am just a phone…. MY body, not YOURS”

(My last text describes a scenario in which the phone-user is almost in a relationship with a phone, the user gives everything to the phone, their personal information, because they trust the phone. Sometimes the phone, just as in a human relationship, cheats on the user. It gives the information, (your personal photos for example), to one another. But you, as phone user can also cheat on the Iphone, you can use Facebook, Instagram or another organization to give them your photos. But maybe the phone thought, the photos were only for him……

We had to exchange our inspection tools and we inspected another object. I exchanged my phone with another one his keys.

OBJECT = Keys

Describe the object from your point of view; what are its performative qualities and affordances; in which context can it be used? How can you use it as an inspection / intervention tool?

Keys can be used to open a door. A backdoor, a front door, the door from your room. Keys can also be used for a bike, or any other public transport medium. As well, keys can be used if you want to protect yourself. A key is sharp. A key is unique, every door has got a different key. A key can also be used for a locker, to hide something. A key is only for you. A key is a
connection to a ‘diary’ as well. It is personal. Do you want to give your keys to anyone else? A key is there to hide something. You hold your keys close to you, don’t want to lose them.

Describe the object from the point of view of the object; build a small glossary for the object - “as if it would speak and have a language of its own”’ you can look into references and find “members of the same family”.

I am a key. Connected to my ‘key family’. I am the key of your front door. Your front door is connected to your home, a place where are your personal belongings are stored. A place in which you sleep, you dress, you shower. You meet other people in your place and you have loads of memories in your home. Where would your home be without me? I am literally the
‘KEY’ to your personal life. Hold me close, if you lose me, it is getting hard to get into your home. Or you have to break in, as a criminal. Then, there grows a lot of distance, between you and your home. I, the key, I am easy. I am a tool. You can use me. You can use me to hold me to yourself. I AM TRAPPED. Maybe I don’t want to be the key of YOUR room, I want to be the key to a house with swimming pool, a cinema and a big car. Or maybe I want to be the key to a candy store? I have nothing to say in this. I was born this way. I can’t change myself. But YOU can change me. If you change your home, or if you take me with you on your journeys. Or my life will in the same house over and over again…..





# 16/05

- Drawing anatomy

We had class from Joseph Hughes at the Drawing station, we did some small exercises and listened to a presentation about hacking.


- Hacking the human body

We had to bring 11 pictures to the class today. A picture of every body part. Eventually, we had to ‘hack’ the human body, by exchanging and combining different body parts. With this, we all created a new persona.





# WEEK 2


# 21/05

- Varia

In week 2 we had a class at Varia.
“Varia (Gouwstraat 3, Rotterdam) is a space for developing collective approaches to everyday technology. varia is an association whose members organize events and collaborate in work groups. varia is around 90m2 and has a 100/35mbps connection. varia works with free software, provides a set of tools. varia figures things out as she goes, tries to keep notes, is bilingual and uses info[@]varia.zone to send and receive emails.”

We worked together with Joana and Varia-member Niek.
At the beginning of the day we had to make a soup out of the ingredients we individually brought. Eventually, the soup consisted out of avocado, chocolate, tomato etc.

This was the begin of a new exercise. The second step was to ‘hack’ a popular soup recipe. We had to hack the recipe into that everyone would eat it. We had to get rid of ingredients which cause allergic reactions. Eventually, we had to post the recipe online to share our ‘hacked’ soup dish.


- Choreography

After the morning in which we made the soup, we did some exercises with Joana for choreography. The final assignment was to hack and perform in connection with an object. Within a group of three decided to look in to the purpose of a ‘chair’. The use of a normal chair can be hacked, if you turn the chair into a table for example. The use can also be hacked if you change the performance before sitting on the chair. You can also stand on a chair, use it as a clothing rack. A lot of ways to hack the system of this object.



# WEEK 3


# 27/05

- Workshop connectology

Together with Shailoh we deepened into the anatomy of connectology. We searched for different objects/purposes of connectology.

I have found a few objects which are lost without a connection. See below.

1.	An electric socket
The socket is an electric connection, it can connect a charger and itself. The charger is needed for an empty device. Without the electric connection the charger can’t be used.
2.	Shoe and its laces
My shoe and its laces are connected through a material connection. Without the shoe laces, my shoe would still be a ‘shoe’, but it would not fit me anymore. The purpose of the shoe would disappear.
3.	Light and light bulb hanging connection
The light bulb and its hanging element are connected through an electric connection.
4.	Credit card and payment method
My credit card and the device to pay are connected through a magnetic connection. The magnetic connection reads the card and the card is again connected with my bank details.

   
 
# HACKING; THE FINAL CONCEPT

I worked together in a group with:
Florian Schuster, Jamal Ata, Arooj Chaudry, Hae Min Lee, Yasyeng Zhang, and myself, Hannah van den Elzen


# OUR PROCESS

We decided to look into a certain, and specific system which interests us, so we afterwards could decide how to hack this system.

We researched the system of art and ownership. With this we were also researching the rules of copyright, a term which is very important within the hacking culture.

Copyright -> it is all about money?
Analog and digital, the way of stealing (music, art, etc.) analog or digitally.
Legal vs illegal
Personal vs commercial
Singing a song (cover) vs the original song
Public vs private -> again, is this all about money?
The value of an artwork/product if it is private or public.

A hacking idea:
Making a weird version of a song and being able to switch it back via speaker, to rip music. (stealing easily). We used the term ‘reverse’ within this hacker idea.

We generated a lot of ideas within our research about copyright and the art/music world.
The Mondrian painting ‘Boogie Woogie’ was our inspiration within this research.

We eventually concluded that we wanted to expand our concept in the way that we are ‘against copyright’. We wanted to create a hack to make a private artwork public. From private to public in either a legal or illegal way.

One of our last ideas (of big importance within our final idea) was to create a pop-up museum as a hack, in which we bring private art to the public.

“You can’t own something if you don’t know how to use it.”
“You don’t own a car if you can’t drive it.”
“You don’t own art if you don’t look at it.”

- Our final concept

We are inspecting the system of private art collections
We are going to intervene/disrupt this system by modifying, putting private art in a new way (or place)
To document: show how we modified private art to public. Show how we modified art original, to our new interpretation.


# OUR FINAL IDEA

We researched copyright rules. We generated our opinion: ‘We wan’t to turn something private, to public’.
We want to ‘hack’ a private painting. We want to steal the painting in a legal way (this is the hack), so the private painting would be available to everyone and everywhere.

The private painting we chose to hack is this painting from Mondrian (see below)


 



We wanted to steal the painting by letting the public experience the painting, without literally seeing it. In this way everyone can enjoy the painting, without stealing it illegally.
Experiencing the painting could be done by using all the human senses except for seeing:

-	(Seeing) based on what you see in your head if you experience the senses, not literally seeing the painting but experiencing it in an other way.
-	Smelling the colours of the painting
-	Touching the layers of the painting
-	Tasting the sweetness/bitterness etc of the painting
-	Hearing the sound which belongs to this painting

We divided the tasks:


Smelling – Florian
Creating smell divided into the colours of the painting

Touching – Hannah and Arooj
Creating structure to feel the actual structure of the painting.

Tasting – Hae Min
Creating a dish with different flavours connected to the colours of the painting.

Hearing – Jamal and Yasheng
Creating sound experience, the notes within the music stand symbol for each colour.

I experimented with different materials to create a ‘feeling’ structure for the Mondrian painting.

We chose the Mondrian painting because it is easy to work with and to connect to other elements such as structure and smell.
Because of the colors and its clear division into abstract forms.

See pictures of my ‘structure’ experiments below:


 

   
  


# A hacked painting.

Our final goal is to create a pop-up museum within school. In this museum you can ‘see’ a private and exclusive painting, which is normally not available to the public. The public can ‘see’ the painting by using the human senses.
The museum will be divided into the different senses.

We are curious if others can guess which painting we showed them.

See our final ‘legal’ experience on the 6th of June!



# WHAT IS HACKING?

With the help of the classes within this practice, and with the research me and my group did. I am able to conclude what hacking means to me.
Hacking is inspecting and intervening within a certain system. Hacking is very broad, this is because the system can be anything. The hack can be anything as well. A product, a experience, a story, etc.

I am very excited about hacking, because the research part is of big importance within this practice. Ofcourse you have to know how a system works and looks, to intervene within it.

Final questions to answer within my file about my ‘Hacking’ experience.


What is the context in which you operated?
The context in which me and my group operated is the art world.

What phygical systems did you investigate?
We investigated the system of copyright and ownership.

What did you find?
We found out that a lot of art is in particular hands, with this it is private and not public. We concluded that art should be available to everyone. In a legal way, to enjoy art, not to make money out of it (commercial part of copyright)

What is your hacking method?
Our hacking method is reversing a system and re-create the meaning of a context.

If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it?
In what way are these tools limited/biased?
Others could use our method by following the steps of experiencing. The purpose of this tool is that it is available for everyone, so not limited and open access.
